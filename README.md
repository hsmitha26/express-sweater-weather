# Sweater Weather (using Express Framework)

Contributor: [Smitha Hosmani](https://github.com/hsmitha26)

## About the Project

A solo project completed in 3 days in Module 4 of Backend Engineering at Turing School of Software and Design.  This was my first attempt at a project in JavaScript.

This app exposes endpoints that return weather forecast for a specific city. It also allows a user to 'favorite' a city and delete a 'favorited' city.  All endpoints require the user to be verified with an API key.

Deployed app: (https://express-weather-forecast.herokuapp.com/)

## Schema

* [Knex.js](http://knexjs.org/)

## Setup

* `git clone git@github.com:hsmitha26/express-sweater-weather.git`
* `npm install`
* Add `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
  * `GEOCODE_API_KEY=<your Google Geodcode API Key>`
  * `DARKSKY_API_KEY=<your Dark Sky API Key>`

To run the server: `npm start`
